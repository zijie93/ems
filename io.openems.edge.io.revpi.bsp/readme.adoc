== Additional application notes
=== Configuration
Kunbus has an internal configuration website, where one can map an 'alias name' to each pin of multiple enhancement boards.
You need to provide this 'alias name' in OpenEMS to get access to the hardware pin.

=== Dependencies
* The RevolutionPi Digital IO OpenEms Bundle depends on the library project `librevpi-dio-java`. A binary version of this library is already included in this OpenEMS Bundle. See https://github.com/clehne/librevpi-dio-java for more information.
* External library was compiled with Java 17 (probably not backwards compatible)
